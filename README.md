# 🗣️ Audio to text grammar scoring web app using AI and Flask

This web application allows users to upload or record audio, converts the speech to text using speech recognition, and provides a grammar score prediction using a trained machine learning model. The interface includes a toggle button for switching between light and dark mode for better accessibility and user experience.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- scikit-learn
- SpeechRecognition
- pyaudio (for real-time recording if implemented)
- Any additional libraries used in your model pipeline

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

git clone https://github.com/Mazid2003/Audio-to-text-grammar-score-web-app-using-AI-and-Flask.git

cd directory

Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Flask App

python app.py

Open your browser and navigate to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

## 🧠 Model Details

The model is trained on labeled audio data.

Audio is converted to text using SpeechRecognition.

Text is preprocessed and passed to a machine learning model (stored in model.pkl) that predicts a grammar score between 0 and 100.

## 💡 Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Flask 🔥

HTML5 & CSS3 🎨

JavaScript (for dark mode toggle)

SpeechRecognition 🎙️

## 📸 UI Preview

**Light Mode ☀️** 

Give an Audio file(.wav file) as input..
